      <a href="/">Krugmantimes.com</a> is a webpage that takes the current
      version of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">New York Times</a> and
      replaces pretty much everything with
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Krugman">Paul Krugman</a>
      media. This means swapping out the masthead, parsing articles for keywords
      and putting in econometrics gibberish, "fixing" the bylines, and replacing
      most of the images with Paul's sweet, sweet mug.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a Node.js app, and the
      <a href="https://github.com/vincentwoo/krugmantimes">source code</a> is
      freely available. It uses Redis as a caching layer on top of the NYT
      as well as the keyword extraction service provided by
      <a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/">Alchemy</a>. If you'd like to talk
      about anything at all, you're more than welcome to email me at
      <a href="mailto:me@vincentwoo.com">me@vincentwoo.com</a>.

      P.S. I love Krugman. Help me get him to acknowledge this by
      <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkrugmantimes.com&amp;text=Behold%2C%20%40NYTimeskrugman%2C%20a%20future%20where%20you%20have%20subsumed%20all%20who%20would%20oppose%20you.">
      tweeting @NYTimeskrugman</a>. It would mean the world to me.

      P.P.S. If you want to see which words and images got swapped out, press
